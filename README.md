# Scoresway_Match_Report

[Scoresway.com](https://www.scoresway.com/en_GB/soccer) is a great website where we can get the match event data of many other leagues which are not available in [whoscored.com](https://www.whoscored.com/)
So, here I have tried to make a post match report using the data from [Scoresway.com](https://www.scoresway.com/en_GB/soccer)
